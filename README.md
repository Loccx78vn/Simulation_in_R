## What is simulation:
Simulation in supply chain management involves creating a virtual model of supply chain operations to analyze and optimize performance. By simulating processes such as production, logistics, inventory management, and customer demand, organizations can test strategies under various scenarios without risking real-world disruptions.

## Simulation in R:
In R, the `simmer` package is commonly used for Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), which helps build detailed models of supply chains. 

Using `simmer`, you can create agents that represent entities (e.g., suppliers, customers) and simulate their interactions and activities over time. This allows for in-depth testing and analysis, helping to improve decision-making in supply chain management.
